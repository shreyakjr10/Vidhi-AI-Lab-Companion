            Deviation ID: DEV-2024-001
            Severity: CRITICAL
            Category: Environmental/Storage
            
            Incident: Temperature excursion detected in raw material storage area RM-05. 
            The environmental monitoring system recorded temperatures of 12°C for 4 hours 
            against the required storage condition of 2-8°C for hygroscopic materials.
            
            Affected Materials: 
            - Batch #MAT-567 of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (Stability compromised)
            - Batch #EXC-890 of critical excipient
            
            Root Cause: HVAC system malfunction combined with operator failure to acknowledge alarm.
            Immediate Impact: Potential product quality impact requiring stability testing.
            
            CAPA: 
            - Immediate quarantine of affected materials
            - HVAC system maintenance and calibration
            - Operator retraining on alarm response procedures
            - Enhanced environmental monitoring frequency
            
            Regulatory Impact: Potential FDA 483 observation for inadequate controls.

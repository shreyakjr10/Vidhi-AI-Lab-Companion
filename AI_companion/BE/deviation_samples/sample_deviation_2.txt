            Deviation ID: DEV-2024-002
            Severity: MAJOR
            Category: Equipment/Manufacturing
            
            Incident: Compression machine CM-02 showed 8% deviation from calibrated pressure settings
            during routine performance qualification. This affected tablet hardness uniformity.
            
            Affected Batch: Batch #TAB-456 showed 15% out-of-specification tablets
            Batch Status: ON HOLD pending investigation
            
            Root Cause: Inadequate preventive maintenance schedule and calibration drift.
            Impact: Product quality impacted, potential batch rejection.
            
            CAPA:
            - Revised preventive maintenance schedule
            - Enhanced calibration frequency from monthly to weekly
            - Operator training on equipment monitoring
            - Implementation of real-time pressure monitoring
            
            Training Required: Equipment operation and monitoring for all operators.
